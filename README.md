## CTF info
  
There are 3 Flags hidden within the application. Because you can download the files locally, it is quite easy to just read the soruce code and find the flag. So i recommend you to start the server and explore it like you would explore a normal web application.
One day I'll try to bake the CTF challenge into a docker container :]
