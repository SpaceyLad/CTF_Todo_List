# CTF_Todo_List

Welcome to my first CTF challenge! Here is a nice little story for context :]

Your friend Mabel Higgins has come to you with an exciting request. She's just created a new website using Flask, a Python micro web framework. Although she's new to Flask, she's convinced that his website is 100% secure. She's asked you to put your cybersecurity skills to the test and try to find any vulnerabilities in her site.

Can you prove her wrong? Can you find the 3 hidden flags that demonstrate the vulnerabilities in her code?

The site is a simple to-do list application. Your Mabel Higgins is confident that she's followed all the best practices in her Flask application. But remember, no system is entirely secure. Keep your eyes open for any XXXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXX and potential XXXXXXXX issues.

Good luck, and happy hunting!

## CTF info
  
There are 3 Flags hidden within the application. Because you can download the files locally, it is quite easy to just read the soruce code and find the flag. So i recommend you to start the server and explore it like you would explore a normal web application.
One day I'll try to bake the CTF challenge into a docker container :]
